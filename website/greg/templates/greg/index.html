    <p>
    This is an experiment being conducted by Greg Mockler
    to gather data on saturation memory. Help me collect data!
    </p>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <p>
        You will be shown a sequence of images in a slideshow. Do your best to remember the brightness, 
        color balance, and general "feeling" of each. Then, you will be shown pairs of the same images, 
        one that was from the slideshow, and one that was modified slightly. Do your best to choose
        the unmodified images in each pair.

        Try to keep your screen brightness constant, and if you use a blue light filter, please turn that off.
